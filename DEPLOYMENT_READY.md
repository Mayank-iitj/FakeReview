## 🔍 Deployment Verification Steps

### Step 1: Run Pre-Deployment Check
```bash
# Windows
.\deploy-check.bat

# Linux/Mac
bash deploy-check.sh
```

Expected output:
```
✅ Python installed
✅ Virtual environment found
✅ Found app/main.py
✅ Found requirements.txt
✅ .env file exists
✅ DATABASE_URL configured
✅ JWT_SECRET_KEY configured
...
✅ SYSTEM IS DEPLOYMENT READY!
```

### Step 2: Initialize Database
```bash
python scripts/init_db.py
```

Expected output:
```
✅ Creating tables...
✅ Database initialized successfully
✅ 6 tables created (Review, Flag, etc.)
```

### Step 3: Test API
```bash
# Start API
uvicorn app.main:app --reload

# In another terminal, test health
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# Expected response
{"status": "ok", "database": "connected"}
```

### Step 4: Start Dashboard
```bash
streamlit run dashboard/app.py
```

Expected:
```
  You can now view your Streamlit app in your browser.
  Local URL: http://localhost:8501
```
