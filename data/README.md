# Data Directory

This directory contains the dataset files for the fake review detector project.

## Expected Files:

- `reviews.csv` - Main dataset with product reviews
  - Columns:
    - `review_text`: The text content of the review
    - `rating`: Product rating (1-5 stars)
    - `label`: 'CG' (Computer Generated/Fake) or 'OR' (Original Review/Genuine)

- `processed_reviews.csv` - Preprocessed version of the dataset (generated by pipeline)

## Dataset Format:

```csv
review_text,rating,label
"This product is amazing! Highly recommend!",5,CG
"It's okay, does what it says but nothing special.",3,OR
...
```

## Getting a Dataset:

If you don't have a dataset, the training pipeline will automatically create a sample dataset for demonstration purposes.

For production use, you can:
1. Use publicly available review datasets (e.g., Amazon reviews, Yelp reviews)
2. Create your own labeled dataset
3. Use the provided sample dataset generation utility

## Notes:

- Large CSV files are excluded from git (see .gitignore)
- Ensure your dataset has the required columns
- The pipeline handles missing values and data validation
